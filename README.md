# DefenseAgainstAdverserialInput
Study of Adversarial Attack and Defense Methods

## Introduction

Neural network is vulnerable to adversarial examples, which means that inputs formed by adding small perturbations will make network output incorrect answer with high confidence. Difficult to apply neural networks in security-critical area.

## Basic Setup

Dataset: Digit-recognition task (0-9) standard dataset MNIST
Network Structure: shown on the right
Our defense method focuses on the CW attack algorithm
